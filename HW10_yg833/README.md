Homework 10

For both assignments this week, I worked by myself largely because I had to use my 72 hour extension on this assignment. I attended office hours and emailed my wonderful TA Ilyas for help with the second half of Assignment 2. He explained the chi2 function that we are looking to define in the notebook. My colleague Soham was also in the same office hour session as well. He was working on the extra credit assignment. 

Assignment 1:
Finish the lab that was started in class. This was largely to illustrate how to look at Likelihood Ratio tests.

Assignment 2:
This assignment was very long and difficult for me. I worked by myself. TA Ilyas and Google helped lot. I referenced a number of different sites in the comments of the notebook. Ilyas helped me with defining a function and also with pointing me to the right places in the lecture slides for help.
