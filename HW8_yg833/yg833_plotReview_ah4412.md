## Clarity
The title of the map makes it clear what the map intends to display. However, most of the instances appear to be only one per PUMA. I suggest aggregating the data at a larger area so that you capture more variation, and consequently more color. Then you could color each area rather than use points on the areas.  

## Esthetic
Gray was a good choice for the background, since the white, pink, and purple contrast well against it. You might consider a different color gradient to keep in mind those with color blindness (the most common type cannot see reds well and may not be able to see the pinks and purples as different from each other and the gray background). Regardless, the use of the labeled gradient bar is very helpful in understanding what the colors mean. I would also suggest making the title larger, since it really helps the reader understand and does not stand out well in a small font.  

## Honesty
As far as I can tell, the map does not appear to be distorted. You might consider adding some detail of the dates this is from though.
