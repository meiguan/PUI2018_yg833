# HW8 Plot Review

## Plot from Yanmei Guan, yg833

### Clarity:
Generally speaking, the plot is easy to understand with the clear color contrast and a colorbar telling the corresponding number of
each color. However, I suggest picking some other colors that are more contrasting. The white color corresponding with 1 instance is 
the same as the background color of the website, which could make the reader feel a little bit uncomfortable when watching the plot 
for a long time. Besides, since nearly all the points plotted on the map are in white, it's actually not that easy to spot the points 
in pink and purple immediately, thus I suggest changing the background color of the map and the colors that represents higher instances,
for example light green, to make the plot look clearer.

### Esthetic:
Esthetically, beside the color selecting issues, I suggest to make the fontsize of the title a little bigger and the colorbar a little
bit smaller to make the whole plot looks more comfortable.

### Honestly:
The plot honestly reflect what the data mean to tell.
