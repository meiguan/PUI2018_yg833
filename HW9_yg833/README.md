# Homework 9

## Redo - HW5 Assigment 2 SQL

As per email from Ilyas via NYU classes, we were given the opportunity to redo/ re-submit the HW5 SQL assignment to do the correct one. This is submitted as the "REDO_HW5_Assignment_2_SQL_query.ipynb"

## Assignment 1

This was done individually. I forked the repos from my assigned colleagues Urwa and Junru. I reviewed their plots and wrote up reviews:
    * um367_plotReview_yg833.md for Urwa
    * lj1230_plotReview_yg833.md for Junru
    
Then I did a pull request to merge the reviews back into their homework 8 folders. 

## Assignment 2:

This was done individually through Googling for better understanding of the OLS and WLS functions in the statsmodel library. I referenced this website as a tutorial: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/index.html

I struggled initially with the line() function provided by Dr. Brianco and I emailed our TA Ilyas about if I was using the function correctly. Ilyas was very helpful and gave me some tips on what else to try via email. Then I found out that my colleague Ross also struggled with getting the same function to work so I shared the email from Ilyas with Ross.

## Assignment 3: 

This assignment was very long.
