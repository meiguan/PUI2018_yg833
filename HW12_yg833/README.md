# Homework 12

## Assignment 1 MTA Subway Timeseries
This assignment is a continuation from the week prior. In the prior week, I worked with a number of colleagues from class - QY (qg412), Jerome (jl9489), Andrea(ah4412), Fekade Brook (fb1182), and Sam (sjf374). Mainly, we worked alongside each other thinking out loud and comparing outputs.

For this week, I worked with QY(qg412), Rachel (rms818), Khloe(kyn227) and Tiffany (tp1600). I had questions about the Fourier Transform part of the assignment and I went to see Dr. Bianco and Ilyas for clarification. Dr. Bianco pointed out to me the error with where I was seeing a peak initially. It was fixed after more investigation. Ilyas helped me with finding the index using argsort. 

My colleague Sam whom I worked with the week prior had similiar questions about the Fourier Transform and I shared with her what I discussed with Dr. Bianco and Ilyas. 

**Extra Credit** 
I attempted the extra credit by myself. It is included at the end of the notebook named: [Assignment_1_subway_timeseries_pt1and2.ipynb](https://github.com/meiguan/PUI2018_yg833/blob/master/HW12_yg833/Assignment_1_subway_timeseries_pt1and2.ipynb)
The notebook linked here is also the one that has the full assignment. In the notebook named "Assignment_1_subway_timseries_pt2.ipynb", it only includes part 4 for the Fourier Transform.

## Assignment 2 Timeseries Clustering

I worked with QY(qg412), Rachel (rms818), and Khloe(kyn227) on Assignment 2. This one was more straightforward, we mainly talked about the different ways of downloading all of the data fields and the data cleaning piece.
